# Operation Minefuck

**Don’t get mined. Mine back.**

Operation Minefuck prototype: Self-as-a-Service profile curator + API server.  
A consent-capitalism experiment, prank, and protest tool.

---

### ✨ What Is This?

- **Self-as-a-Service**: A daemon that builds a sellable profile from your life (on your hardware).
- **Consent Capitalism**: You define categories, set a minimum bid, and block anything you don’t vibe with.
- **Weaponized Absurdity**: Profiles can be real, fake, or surreal. Poison the well if you want.

### 🚀 Repo Contents
- `prototype/` → the first working PoC (profile curator + API server).
- `docs/manifesto.md` → Operation Minefuck statement.
- `docs/tricksters_testament.md` → Discordian-style “inheritance” for future pranksters.
- `roadmap.md` → ideas, features, and experiments in progress.

- # Operation Minefuck Roadmap

This is not a roadmap. This is a treasure map with shifting landmarks.  
Still, here’s a rough sketch of where the ship might sail:

## Phase 0 — The Joke Becomes Code
- [x] Upload initial prototype release (profile curator + API server).  
- [x] Add README, LICENSE, .gitignore.  
- [ ] Draft manifestos, testaments, and absurdist docs.  

## Phase 1 — Functional Mischief
- [ ] Flesh out the profile curator (make it actually gather usable data).  
- [ ] Build minimal API endpoints for interaction.  
- [ ] Add a public dashboard view (mock or real).  

## Phase 2 — Weaponized Absurdity
- [ ] Profiles can be surreal (nonsense, art, satire).  
- [ ] Fake data injection tools (“fnord injectors”).  
- [ ] Public release packaging (zip, docker, etc.).  

## Phase 3 — Consent Capitalism Experiments
- [ ] Define categories & bidding mechanics.  
- [ ] Test self-owned metadata markets.  
- [ ] See if anyone bites.

### Long-Term Dreams

- [ ] Cross-platform daemon (Linux, Windows, maybe mobile).  
- [ ] Integration with decentralized infra (IPFS, ICP, or Solana).  
- [ ] Alternate reality game tie-ins.  
- [ ] Make surveillance capitalism regret looking our way.
