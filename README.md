# Operation Minefuck

**Don’t get mined. Mine back.**

Operation Minefuck prototype: Self-as-a-Service profile curator + API server.  
A consent-capitalism experiment, prank, and protest tool.

---

### ✨ What Is This?

- **Self-as-a-Service**: A daemon that builds a sellable profile from your life (on your hardware).
- **Consent Capitalism**: You define categories, set a minimum bid, and block anything you don’t vibe with.
- **Weaponized Absurdity**: Profiles can be real, fake, or surreal. Poison the well if you want.
