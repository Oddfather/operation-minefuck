# Contributing to Operation Minefuck

First off: thanks for even considering throwing chaos into this experiment.  
This project is half prototype, half prank, and entirely open to mischief.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork bravely.** Clone the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request.  
- **Be weird, but clear.** Code should be functional, docs can be absurdist.  
- **Respect the balance.** Every fnord should carry a grain of truth.  

## What We’re Looking For

- Bug fixes (real or invented).  
- Documentation improvements (serious or surreal).  
- New features (working PoC or satirical sketches).  
- Issues / discussions to stir the pot.  

## Code of Conduct

Discordian principle applies:  
*We are all popes, so act like one.*  

In practical terms: don’t be a jerk. Respect contributors, even (especially) when they’re absurd.
