Trickster’s Testament
To Whom It May Concern (and those it does not):

I leave to you not wealth, nor wisdom, but mischief.
Mischief enough to short-circuit a mainframe, confuse a census taker,
or make an algorithm choke on its own tail.

You are hereby entrusted with the sacred duty:

Question every fnord.
When you see words that itch behind your eyes, scratch them until they bleed meaning.

Poison the well of certainty.
The world is awash in smooth narratives. Toss pebbles of contradiction until ripples appear.

Celebrate absurdity as resistance.
For a joke, well-timed, can collapse a tyrant’s logic faster than any weapon.

Claim pope-hood.
All beings are popes, equally infallible and equally ridiculous. Take your mitre, wear it sideways.

Don’t get mined. Mine back.
Your metadata is your myth — write it yourself. Sell it, fake it, paint it in neon lies.

The Testament’s Seal

This document is genuine, authentic, self-signed, and retroactively notarized
by the House of Holy Discord and Improvised Kabuki.
If questioned, simply declare: I am the Trickster’s heir, and my license is laughter.

Take this Testament and fork it. Mutate it. Shove it into code, graffiti, or performance art.
So long as it breeds more questions than answers, the chain of mischief is unbroken.

Witness my hand, which is really just your hand,
since the Trickster writes through whoever dares to hold the pen.
