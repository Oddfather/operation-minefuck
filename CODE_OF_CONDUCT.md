# Code of Conduct — Operation Minefuck

## The Discordian Principle
Everyone is a pope here. That means you are infallible in matters spiritual,  
at least as far as you yourself go, and that’s pretty far.

## Practical Translation
- Respect fellow contributors, even when they are absurd.  
- Satire is welcome; harassment is not.  
- Debate ideas, not people.  
- Misrule is encouraged, cruelty is not.  

## Golden Fnord Rule
Do what you wish, so long as it doesn’t trample on another’s freedom to do the same.  

## Enforcement
This is an absurdist project, but community health is serious.  
If someone is being a jerk, maintainers may: warn, mute, or boot.  
We prefer dialogue first, exile last.

*Remember: The universe is a joke. We are here to laugh, build, and subvert — not to wound.*
