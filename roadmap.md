# Operation Minefuck Roadmap

This is not a roadmap. This is a treasure map with shifting landmarks.  
Still, here’s a rough sketch of where the ship might sail:

## Phase 0 — The Joke Becomes Code
- [x] Upload initial prototype release (profile curator + API server).  
- [x] Add README, LICENSE, .gitignore.  
- [ ] Draft manifestos, testaments, and absurdist docs.  

## Phase 1 — Functional Mischief
- [ ] Flesh out the profile curator (make it actually gather usable data).  
- [ ] Build minimal API endpoints for interaction.  
- [ ] Add a public dashboard view (mock or real).  

## Phase 2 — Weaponized Absurdity
- [ ] Profiles can be surreal (nonsense, art, satire).  
- [ ] Fake data injection tools (“fnord injectors”).  
- [ ] Public release packaging (zip, docker, etc.).  

## Phase 3 — Consent Capitalism Experiments
- [ ] Define categories & bidding mechanics.  
- [ ] Test self-owned metadata markets.  
- [ ] See if anyone bites.

### Long-Term Dreams

- Cross-platform daemon (Linux, Windows, maybe mobile).  
- Integration with decentralized infra (IPFS, ICP, or Solana).  
- Alternate reality game tie-ins.  
- Make surveillance capitalism regret looking our way.
